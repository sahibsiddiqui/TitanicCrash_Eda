# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to explore the data, clean it, visualize key relationships, and uncover insights about passenger survival- all without using any machine learning models.

### Objectives
- Understand the structure and key attributes of the Titanic dataset
- Clean and preprocess missing or irrelevant data
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis using Python
- Visualize survival trends based on gender, age, passenger class, and embarkation port
- Draw meaningful conclusions from observed patterns

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib – for visualization

### Dataset Information
